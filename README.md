# Design of flexure based resonant translating micromirror

This project was done for the course C294A - Compliant Mechanism Design at UCLA.

This project proposes a design of a flexure-based translating micromirror operated at its resonant frequency, driven by repulsive electrostatic force. The device is meant to modulate the phase of light reflected off its surface for a variety of high-impact precision applications such as adaptive optics. Besides achieving single translation DOF orthogonal to the reflective surface, other design considerations include the minimization of parasitic errors, minimization of over-constrained and under-constrained topology and fabrication feasibility. A single-degree-of-freedom model is used based on the FACT approach for compliant mechanism design developed by Prof. Jonathan Hopkins to guide the design process. The behavior of the design is analyzed through calculations of the resonant frequencies and their corresponding mode shapes in MATLAB, and validated using FEA-based modal analysis in ANSYS and SolidWorks. The design is to be fabricated using a CMOS-compatible SOI process.
